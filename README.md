# 🌊 Pravah - Flood Detection Project

> **Pravah** (प्रवाह) - word meaning "flow" or "current"

## 📋 Project Overview

**Pravah** is a beginner-friendly machine learning project for learning data science fundamentals. The goal is to build a **binary classification** model that can predict whether a disaster event is a **Flood** or some **Other** type of disaster.

### 🎯 Learning Goals
- Learn basic data exploration and analysis
- Understand how to work with CSV datasets
- Practice using pandas, numpy, and visualization libraries
- Build my first machine learning classification model

```

## � What I've Done So Far

### ✅ **Environment Setup** 
- Created virtual environment (`venv`)
- Installed required Python libraries
- Set up Jupyter notebook for data exploration

### ✅ **Data Exploration (Current Phase)**
- Basic data loading with pandas
- Dataset shape and structure analysis
- Statistical summaries using `describe()` and `info()`
- Missing value detection with `isna().sum()`
- Duplicate row checking

## 📊 Current Progress

**Phase 1: Data Exploration** 🔄 **(Currently Working On)**
- ✅ Load dataset with pandas
- ✅ Check dataset shape and basic info
- ✅ Identify missing values
- ✅ Check for duplicates
- 🔄 Explore feature distributions
- ⏳ Visualize data patterns

**Phase 2: Data Cleaning** ⏳ **(Next Steps)**
- Handle missing values
- Remove or fix duplicates
- Basic data preprocessing

**Phase 3: Model Building** ⏳ **(Future)**
- Split data into training/testing
- Train a simple classification model
- Evaluate model performance

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Basic knowledge of Python

### What I Did to Set Up

1. **Cloned the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rajath-Raj/pravah_flood_detection.git
   cd pravah_flood_detection
   ```

2. **Created virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. **Installed basic libraries**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Started Jupyter notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook flood_data_exploration.ipynb
   ```

## 📦 Libraries I'm Learning

| Library | What I'm Using It For |
|---------|----------------------|
| `pandas` | Loading and exploring CSV data |
| `numpy` | Basic numerical operations |
| `matplotlib` | Creating simple plots (coming soon) |
| `seaborn` | Making prettier visualizations (coming soon) |
| `jupyter` | Interactive data exploration |






### Next Steps
- [ ] Add some basic visualizations
- [ ] Understand the dataset better
- [ ] Learn about different data types
- [ ] Start basic data cleaning
